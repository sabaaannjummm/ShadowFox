## Project Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive methodology used in the Cricket Fielding Performance Analysis project. The analysis follows a structured data science workflow from data collection through advanced analytics to strategic recommendations.

## 1. Data Collection & Preparation

### 1.1 Data Sources
- **Primary Dataset**: IPL fielding performance data for Delhi Capitals
- **Sample**: 7 players from match IPL2367 at Arun Jaitley Stadium
- **Timeframe**: Single match analysis with complete fielding metrics

### 1.2 Data Structure
The dataset contains the following key metrics for each player:

| Metric | Description | Type | Weight |
|--------|-------------|------|---------|
| `clean_picks` | Clean field pick-ups | Integer | +1 |
| `good_throws` | Accurate throws | Integer | +1 |
| `catches` | Successful catches | Integer | +3 |
| `dropped_catches` | Missed catches | Integer | -3 |
| `stumpings` | Wicket-keeper stumpings | Integer | +3 |
| `run_outs` | Successful run outs | Integer | +3 |
| `missed_run_outs` | Missed run out opportunities | Integer | -2 |
| `direct_hits` | Direct hits on stumps | Integer | +2 |
| `runs_saved` | Net runs saved/conceded | Integer | As is |

### 1.3 Data Validation Process
- **Missing Values Check**: Verify no null values in critical fields
- **Negative Value Validation**: Ensure count fields have non-negative values
- **Data Type Verification**: Confirm proper data types for all columns
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and remove duplicate records
- **Consistency Checks**: Validate team and match information consistency

## 2. Performance Score Calculation

### 2.1 Official Performance Formula
The performance score is calculated using the official cricket fielding formula:
